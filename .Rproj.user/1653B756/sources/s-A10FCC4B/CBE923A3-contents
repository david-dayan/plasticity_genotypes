Does cryptic genetic variation contribute to the adaptive divergence of freshwater populations of threespine stickleback? Let's get that genomic data to start figuring it out.

This log describes the process of genotyping 2600 stickleback from raw illumina hiseq reads using Stacks v2. It described all bioinformatics around quality control, filtering, calling genotypes and analysis of coverage and genotyping error rates.
