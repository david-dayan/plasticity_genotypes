For those of you that are looking for a quick way to concatenate your samples, you could try this:

Suppose you have a text file named \"indiv\" that has the names if your samples, and your FASTQ files are in a directory named \"samples\":

$ ls
indiv  samples
$ mkdir samples_concat
for i in `cat indiv`; do cat samples/$i* > samples_concat/$i.fq.gz; done

Or, if you already have your population assignment file 'pops':

$ ls
pops  samples
$ mkdir samples_concat
$ for i in `awk '{print $1}' pops`; do cat samples/$i* > samples_concat/$i.fq.gz; done


```"
