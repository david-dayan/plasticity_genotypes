Read 38505561773 BAM records:
  kept 31589809638 primary alignments (83.9%), of which 15560702018 reverse reads
  skipped 2472966745 primary alignments with insufficient mapping qualities (6.6%)
  skipped 2433081192 excessively soft-clipped primary alignments (6.5%)
  skipped 1149879071 unmapped reads (3.1%)
  skipped some suboptimal (secondary/supplementary) alignment records

  Per-sample stats (details in 'gstacks.log.distribs'):
    read 16895814.7 records/sample (646-70470513)
    kept 10.4%-85.9% of these

Built 1922504 loci comprising 16029107620 forward reads and 14566108785 matching paired-end reads; mean insert length was 249.4 (sd: 78.2).
Removed 1462998835 unpaired (forward) reads (9.1%); kept 14566108785 read pairs in 1788198 loci.
Removed 3758113517 read pairs whose insert length had already been seen in the same sample as putative PCR duplicates (25.8%); kept 10807995268 read pairs.

Genotyped 1788198 loci:
  effective per-sample coverage: mean=11.8x, stdev=5.8x, min=1.0x, max=40.1x
  mean number of sites per locus: 437.7
  a consistent phasing was found for 229618780 of out 241108686 (95.2%) diploid loci needing phasing
